# Course: Unit Testing for TypeScript and Node.js Developers with Jest

## Description

A course focused on both the practical and theoretical aspects of automated testing with Jest and TypeScript. The content covers everything from foundational concepts to advanced techniques for unit and integration testing, including Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices and CI/CD automation using Docker and GitHub Actions.

## Topics Covered

- **Fundamentals of Unit Testing with Jest and TypeScript**  
  Basic test structure, use of matchers, assertions, and environment setup.

- **Intermediate and Advanced Jest Techniques**  
  Working with hooks, snapshots, custom matchers, spies, and mocks.  
  Creating test doubles and isolating external dependencies.

- **Database and Docker Testing**  
  Running integrated tests in containers to simulate real data persistence scenarios.

- **Continuous Integration (CI/CD)**  
  Setting up pipelines with GitHub Actions and automating test execution in integration environments.

- **Testing with React and TypeScript**  
  Unit testing React components using Jest and React Testing Library, focusing on behavior and rendering validation.

## Final Remarks

I took this course to deepen my understanding and broaden my perspective on the testing ecosystem. Although I already had experience with automated testingboth unit and integration teststhe course helped consolidate best practices and explore more advanced topics.

The key takeaways included using **GitHub Actions** integrated with **Docker** to run test pipelines with a real database, as well as hands-on experience with **React Testing Library**. I also improved my understanding of **testing patterns**, **organization**, and **optimization**, reinforcing a more professional and scalable approach to automated testing.
